# üöÄ Project: Social Media Campaign Performance Tracker

## **The Sparks Foundation - Data Science & Business Analytics Internship (GRIP)**

## **üìã Introduction**
This project was completed as a core task for the Data Science & Business Analytics Internship at The Sparks Foundation. The objective is to gain real-world exposure to how businesses evaluate the success of their advertising campaigns using performance data.
The goal is to analyze a dataset of social media ad results and build an interactive dashboard that helps a marketing team understand campaign effectiveness and make data-driven decisions.

## **üéØ Task Overview: Track & Visualize Ad Performance**
The main task was to work with a simulated CSV dataset from an ads manager (like Facebook or Instagram) to:

  =>Analyze key campaign performance metrics.

  =>Identify which ads had the highest engagement.

  =>Calculate and track important KPIs like Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Cost Per Click (CPC).

  =>Build a dashboard to visualize these insights and suggest improvements for future campaigns.

## **üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Used**
File: data.csv

Source: A simulated social media ads performance dataset containing metrics such as impressions, clicks, cost, conversions, and demographic information (age, gender).

## **üõ†Ô∏è Tool Used**
Google Looker Studio (formerly Data Studio)

An interactive dashboard was built from scratch using Google Looker Studio to visualize the data and present the findings in a clear, easy-to-understand format.

## **‚ú® Dashboard Features**
The final Looker Studio dashboard includes:

1. KPI Scorecards

      Bar Chart: Compares the performance of different ad campaigns.

      Pie Charts: Breaks down performance by key demographics like age and gender.

3. Interactive Filters
      The entire report can be filtered by Date Range, Campaign Name, Age, and Gender, allowing for deeper, more granular analysis.
